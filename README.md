# Get-Clean-Data
This repo contains the code for the getting and cleaning data project. There is a separate file describing the variables. 
The code follows the steps mentioned in the project and generates the desired output.
It merges the data sets after obtaining them. It then retrieves the mean and standard deviation, labels them and finally generates a tidy data set.
